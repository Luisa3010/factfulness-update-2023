# An Update on Factfulness in 2024

I recently began reading "Factfulness", written by Hans Rosling, along with his son Ola Rosling and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling RÃ¶nnlund. For those unfamiliar, the book sheds light on how we often perceive the world as being more negative and hostile than it truly is. We tend to exaggerate the prevalence of child mortality due to hunger, ongoing wars, and fatalities from natural disasters, while overlooking the positive developments occurring globally. When questioned about the number of people being lifted out of poverty or the improvement in access to basic healthcare, the majority of responses are more pessimistic than if answers were chosen at random. Essentially, we humans are inclined towards a negativity bias regarding the state of the world.

Using data, numbers, and graphs, "Factfulness" aims to correct our misconceptions and demonstrate how our simplistic views of the world are often mistaken. However, the data presented in the book dates back to 2017, and a lot has changed since then. With the recent coronavirus pandemic, in particular, it feels like the world is regressing to darker times. Yet, those familiar with "Factfulness" understand the importance of not taking our intuitive feelings as ultimate truth. Therefore i set out to investigate how our planet really has evolved since the year 2017.
