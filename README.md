# An Update on Factfulness in 2024

I recently began reading "Factfulness", written by Hans Rosling, along with his son Ola Rosling and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling RÃ¶nnlund. For those unfamiliar, the book sheds light on how we often perceive the world as being more negative and hostile than it truly is. We tend to exaggerate the prevalence of child mortality due to hunger, ongoing wars, and fatalities from natural disasters, while overlooking the positive developments occurring globally. When questioned about the number of people being lifted out of poverty or the improvement in access to basic healthcare, the majority of responses are more pessimistic than if answers were chosen at random. Essentially, we humans are inclined towards a negativity bias regarding the state of the world.

Using data, numbers, and graphs, "Factfulness" aims to correct our misconceptions and demonstrate how our naive views of the world are often mistaken. However, the data presented in the book dates back to 2017, and a lot has changed since then. Especially with the recent coronavirus pandemic, it feels like the world is regressing to darker times. 
Those of you who are familiar with "Factfulness" probably know not to take these intuitive feelings as the ultimate truth. Therefore I set out to investigate the data in 2024 to see what has really happened since 2017.

## Child Mortality and Birth Rates 

The first graph we come across in the book shows with how many children are born per woman and compares this to the number of children surviving to the age of five. Here we can clearly see the trend from before 2017 continuing until 2021 (when the most recent data was collected).

So in this case it seems like our gut feeling led us astray. There is no sudden drop of the survival rate or increase in children born. But child survival rates might just be something changing slower and the recent developements might just not show their impact quite yet. So lets go on and explore further.
