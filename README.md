# An Update on Factfulness in 2024

I recently started reading the book Factfulness by Hans Rosling, his son Ola Rosling and daughter-in-law Anna Rosling RÃ¶nnlund. 
In case you are not familiar with the book, it focuses on different aspects in which we percieve the world as more negative and hostile than it actually is. 
We tend to overestimate the number of children dying of hunger, wars being fought or fatalities from natural disasters. At the same time we miss the positive trends happening in the world.
When asked how many people are lifted out of poverty or how good the access to basic healthcare is, almost all people answer worse than if you just picked answers randomly.
In short - us humans have a negativity bias when it comes to the state of the world. //  

The book uses numbers and graphs to uncover our misjudgments and to show in various examples just how skewed our naive world view is. 
However, the data used in Factfulness is from 2017 and much has happened in the world since then. 
Especially with recent corona pandemic it feels like the world is actually reverting back to a darker place.      
But if you are familiar with Factfulness you know better than to blindly believe your feelings. Thats why I decided to set out and see for myself how our planet developed since good old 2017. //
